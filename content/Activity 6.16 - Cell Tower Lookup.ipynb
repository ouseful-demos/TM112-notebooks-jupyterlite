With access to such an API, we can create our own equivalent service.\n\nGeolocation APIs such as the Google geolocation API, or the <s>[`openbmap API`](https://radiocells.org/geolocation)</s> [*no longer operational*], which is compatible with the Google geolocation API, allow look-ups of the geographical location (latitude and longitude co-ordinates) of cell towers and wifi hotspots based on their unique IDs.\n\nIn mid-2018, the Google geolocation API changed from a free service to a pay-as-you-go service requiring API key access. The `openbmap` API is compatible with the Google geolocation API — that is, it uses the same data format when making a request to the API and when receiving a data response from it — but it's availability cannot be guaranteed.\n\n\nIn this activity you will see how to call the API services *in principle*, if not in fact.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Walk-through of How to Call the API\n\nThe following walk through demonstrates how to call the API.
