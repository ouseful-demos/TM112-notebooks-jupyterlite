The locations are collected by wardriving - driving along public roads, listening out for WiFi hotspots, grabbing their name (SSID) and unique identfier (BSSID) and associating them with your current location. That's why the locations on the WiGLE interactive map typically appear by the roadside. (Zoom the map to show your location to see how many hotspots have been identifed near it.)\n\nIn the same way that we could in principle use a service such as the Google geolocation or `openbmap` APIs to look up the location of a mobile phone cell tower ([Activity 6.16 - Cell Tower Lookup.ipynb](Activity%206.16%20-%20Cell%20Tower%20Lookup.ipynb)), we can also use them to look up the location of a WiFi hotspot from its BSSID (*Basic Service Set IDentifier*).\n\nIf your computer has wifi access and is in range of one or more WiFi hostpots, you should be able to identify the MAC addresses of them using the following commands. The name of each hotspot in range should be given as the SSID, and the code you need for the lookup as the BSSID.\n\nOn your computer, run the appropriate command depending on the operating system you are using. *In order to detect nearby Wifi hostspots, you will need to ensure that your computer's WiFi is turned on.* The BSSID and SSID values should be displayed in the output report.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Notebook Terminal\n\nIf you are running the notebook from a notebook server installed directly on your own computer, you should be able to run the following commands in a [Jupyter terminal launched from here](/j/terminals/1).
