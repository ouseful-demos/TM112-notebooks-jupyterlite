Instead, it's something to whet your curiosity. Something to show you how, with a few lines of Python code, you can start to work with live, third-party datasources and online services to perform real-world programming tasks.\n\nIf something doesn't work: *DON'T PANIC*. You won't break your computer and you won't break the internet. And you won't fail the module if you just move on!\n\nThe location data we will consider includes:\n\n- <a href=\"#addresses\">Activity 6.22 - Geocoding an address using an API</a>\n- <a href=\"#postcodes\">Activity 6.23 - Geocoding addresses and postcodes</a>\n- <a href=\"#IPaddresses\">Activity 6.24 - Geocoding an IP address</a>\n- <a href=\"#revgeopostcode\">Activity 6.25 - Reverse geocoding a postcode</a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a name=\"addresses\"></a>\n## Activity 6.22 - Geocoding an address using an API\n\nWhen Google Maps first appeared in 2005, it existed primarily as a browser based application. Developers soon started to identify the remote Google services that the application relied on and an official API soon followed, along with APIs for other geo-related services such as geocoding.\n\nSince then, a wide range of other providers have opened up publicly accessible geo-related services, including openly licensed mapping services such as OpenStreetmap, as well as geocoding and geolcation services.\n\nMany of these services are accessed programmatically using an API. Some of them, such as the Google APIs, require personal API keys which are associated with registered users and can be used to track, and bill for, usage. Other services, such as Open Street Map, and its associated [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/) service, still publish open endpoints that *do not* require an API key.\n\nDo not worry in this activity about the detail of how the call to the API is constructed using Python code or how the response is constructed. The main aim of this activity is simply to demonstrate that small amounts of code *can* be used to generate requests to third party online services, parse the response, and do something simple with it. However, if you do peek into the entrails of the data object that is returned, you may be able to identify recognisable things within it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Make sure various required packages are installed:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install folium \ntry:\n    import micropip\n    await micropip.install(\"https://opencomputinglab.github.io/vce-wheelhouse/wheelhouse/MarkupSafe-2.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\")\n    await micropip.install('branca')\n    await micropip.install(\"requests\")  \n    await micropip.install(\"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/c3/83/e8cb37afc2f016a1cf4caab8d22caf7fe4156c4c15230d8abc9c83547e0c/folium-0.12.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\")\nexcept:\n    pass","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The Python `requests` package makes it easy to call URLs using Python.\n\nHowever, in a `jupyterlite` / `pyodide environment`, the `requests` package cannot access SSl protected *https* addressed web locations, so we need to find an alternative way to retrieve resources from such web locations into the Python environment.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n    import pyodide\n    pyolite=True\n    \n    from requests import Request\n    import json\n    from pyodide import to_js\n    from js import Object\n    import js\n\n    def get(url, params=None, raw=False):\n        p = Request(\"GET\",url,\n                        params=params).prepare() if params else Request(\"GET\",url)\n        resp = pyodide.open_url(p.url).read()\n        return resp if raw else json.loads(resp)\n    \n    def post(url, params=None):\n        params = {} if params is None else params\n        resp = await js.fetch(url,\n              method= \"POST\",\n              body = json.dumps(params),\n              credentials= \"same-origin\",\n              headers= Object.fromEntries(to_js({ \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" })),\n            )\n        return resp\nexcept:\n    pyolite=False\n    \n    import requests\n    #Â Wrap the requests package\n    def get(url, params=None, raw=False):\n        resp = requests.get(url, params=params) if params else requests.get(url)\n        return resp.text if raw else resp.json()\n    \n    def post(url, params=None):\n        params = {} if params is None else params\n        return requests.post(url, params=params).json()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Specify the address for which we want to find the geocoded location (you could use your own address here):","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"address='Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, UK'","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we can construct a URL to call on the Nomimatim web service using this address as an argument.\n\nNote that we are also requesting that the service provides a response using JSON (Javascript Object Notation) formatted data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Construct a request to the Nominatim geolocatio service using our desired address\nr = get(\"https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search\", params={'q': address, 'format':'json'})\nr#.json()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Try rerunning the previous cell with an address that is familiar to you.

For example, if the variable `mypostcode` is set to the `dict` shown above, we could access the contents of the main `result` part of the data structure by writing: `mypostcode[\"result\"]`.\n\nTo obtain the value of items in deeper nested parts of the data structure, we simply add further levels of relative addressing.
